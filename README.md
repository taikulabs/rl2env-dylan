Repo2RLEnv synthesizes **verifiable** training and evaluation data from existing repositories, exports it into a uniform spec, and pushes it straight to the Hugging Face Hub. The output spec is [Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor)'s, so every dataset you produce drops directly into any Harbor-compatible runtime — no glue code.


## Quickstart

```bash
# Install (pick one)
uv add repo2rlenv                                 # add to a uv-managed project
uvx repo2rlenv --help                             # one-shot, no install
pip install repo2rlenv                            # classic

# Auth: nothing to set up if you've done `gh auth login` and `huggingface-cli login`.
# Otherwise:  export GITHUB_TOKEN=... ; export HF_TOKEN=...

# Generate a dataset locally
repo2rlenv generate \
  --repo <owner>/<repo> \
  --pipeline pr_runtime \
  --pipeline-opt limit=5 \
  --llm anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --out ./datasets/<dataset-name>

# Validate (fast structural check) and publish
repo2rlenv validate ./datasets/<dataset-name>
repo2rlenv push ./datasets/<dataset-name> <your-org>/<dataset-name>

# Anyone can pull + run a published dataset on a fresh machine
repo2rlenv pull <your-org>/<dataset-name> ./datasets/<dataset-name>
harbor run -p ./datasets/<dataset-name> -a oracle --env docker
```

Full walkthrough in [**`docs/quickstart.md`**](./docs/quickstart.md).

## How it works

Repo2RLEnv runs **synthesis pipelines** that read real repositories — source code, merged PRs, commits, CVEs — and use them as a *seed* to generate RL environments: tasks with a concrete, solvable objective and a programmatic reward (no human grading).

**Input: any repo. Output: a runnable RL environment** you can point any LLM or coding agent at.

```python
# every pipeline shares one contract: read a repo, emit verifiable tasks
class Pipeline(Protocol):
    name: ClassVar[PipelineName]
    def run(self, out_dir: Path) -> PipelineResult: ...   # writes tasks/<id>/
```

Generate from a repo, then run any agent against the result — the environment is scored automatically:

```bash
# 1. synthesize an environment from a repo
repo2rlenv generate --repo pallets/click --pipeline pr_runtime \
  --pipeline-opt limit=10 --llm anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 --out ./env-click

# 2. run an agent inside the sandbox (swap -a / -m for any of 25+ harnesses)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...   OPENAI_API_KEY=...
harbor run -p ./env-click -a claude-code -m anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 --ae ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --env docker
harbor run -p ./env-click -a openhands   -m openai/gpt-4o               --ae OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY     --env docker
harbor run -p ./env-click -a codex       -m openai/o3                   --ae OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY     --env docker
harbor run -p ./env-click -a hermes      -m anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 --ae ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --env docker
```

Each agent's per-task reward lands in `/logs/verifier/reward.json`, ready for training or eval.

## Pipelines

A pipeline turns a repo into Harbor tasks. **Three are stable** and recommended for production; **three are experimental** — usable today (the CLI prints a warning before they run), with interfaces and output quality still evolving.

### Stable

**[`pr_diff`](./docs/pipelines/pr_diff.md)** mines merged pull-request diffs into lightweight, text-only tasks. The agent proposes an edit, and a verifier scores it against the real merged diff — on format, the files it touched, how much it changed, and (via an LLM judge) whether it's semantically right. No per-repo setup: every task ships a thin `python:3.12-slim` image.
→ Reference dataset: [`AdithyaSK/repo2rlenv-pr-diff`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AdithyaSK/repo2rlenv-pr-diff) (100 oracle-verified tasks).

**[`pr_runtime`](./docs/pipelines/pr_runtime.md)** is the SWE-bench-style flagship. It mines merged PRs and actually runs the repo's test suite inside a Docker sandbox: the tests the PR fixed must go from failing to passing under the gold patch, while the rest keep passing. That makes it the strongest, least-gameable signal of the set.
→ Reference dataset: [`AdithyaSK/repo2rlenv-pr-runtime`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AdithyaSK/repo2rlenv-pr-runtime) (100 oracle-verified tasks).

**[`commit_runtime`](./docs/pipelines/commit_runtime.md)** is `pr_runtime`'s sibling for repos that don't gate fixes behind PRs (squash-merge / direct-to-main / GitLab / local). It mines **commits** directly, runs the repo's tests in a sandbox (same graded F2P/P2P reward), and an LLM rewrites each commit/issue into a clean, leak-free problem statement so the task isn't gameable.
→ Reference dataset: [`AdithyaSK/repo2rlenv-commit-runtime`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AdithyaSK/repo2rlenv-commit-runtime) (100 oracle-verified envs; Opus solves the sampled tasks).

→ All reference datasets: [**Verifiable RL Environments collection**](https://huggingface.co/collections/AdithyaSK/repo2rlenv-verifiable-rl-environments)

### Experimental

> These run normally but emit a warning first — pin a release if you depend on them. Each links to its own page; the gist:

- **[`cve_patches`](./docs/pipelines/cve_patches.md)** — security tasks from public CVEs, mapped to their fix commits.
- **[`code_instruct`](./docs/pipelines/code_instruct.md)** — generates a problem + executable verifier from a real source file.
- **[`equivalence_tests`](./docs/pipelines/equivalence_tests.md)** — the agent reimplements a real function; generated tests check it matches the original.
- **[`pr_chain`](./docs/pipelines/pr_chain.md)** — **long-horizon**: one env per contiguous run of history, split into PR-gated stages. Emitted as a native Harbor multi-step task — at least 100 steps, one per milestone, each graded by its own tests in a fresh verifier environment; reward is the mean per-step F2P/P2P score.

### At a glance

| Pipeline | Stability | Source | Reward signal | Sandbox | LLM use | Languages |
|---|:-:|:-:|---|:-:|---|---|
| `pr_diff` | stable | GitHub · GitLab | `diff_similarity` | thin | at verify — judges the solution | any |
| `pr_runtime` | stable | GitHub · GitLab | `test_execution` + `diff_similarity` | ✅ | at env build — one-time, cached | Py · Go · Node · Rust |
| `commit_runtime` | stable | GitHub · GitLab · local | `test_execution` + `diff_similarity` | ✅ | at env build + per-task instruction synthesis | Py · Go · Node · Rust |
| `cve_patches` | experimental | GitHub | `test_execution` + `diff_similarity` | ✅ | at env build — one-time, cached | Py · Go · Node · Rust |
| `code_instruct` | experimental | GitHub · GitLab · local | `test_execution` | ✅ | at synthesis — writes the task | Py |
| `equivalence_tests` | experimental | GitHub · GitLab · local | `test_execution` | ✅ | at synthesis — writes the task | Py |
| `pr_chain` | experimental | GitHub · GitLab | `test_execution` (mean over steps) | ✅ | at env build — one-time, cached | Py |

**What the columns mean**
- **Source** — where `--repo` can point. **`GitHub · GitLab · local`** = a GitHub `owner/name`, a `gitlab.com` URL, **or a local path** (`/abs`, `./rel`, `~`, `file://`); these need only git + source files. **`GitHub · GitLab`** = PR/MR-mining pipelines (work on github.com and gitlab.com, not a bare local clone — no pull/merge requests there). **`GitHub`** = needs the GitHub commit API + OSV CVE data (`cve_patches`). `generate` blocks an unsupported source up front with a clear, actionable error.
- **Reward signal** — the verifiable signal emitted per task. `test_execution` = the repo's own tests gate the reward (F2P/P2P or pytest pass rate); `diff_similarity` = the agent's output is scored against the oracle diff (format, file targeting, region overlap, LLM judge). Pipelines that emit both use `test_execution` as the primary training signal.
- **Sandbox** — whether the task runs inside Docker. `✅` = a per-repo image is built once by the [bootstrap phase](#bootstrap) and cached; `thin` = no bootstrap, just a generic `python:3.12-slim` image.
- **LLM use** — *when* a language model is invoked, which sets where your API cost goes:
  - **at env build** — only during bootstrap (constructing the Docker image); cached, so generation itself is LLM-free.
  - **at synthesis** — the model authors the task (problem + verifier) for every task generated.
  - **at verify** — the model judges the agent's solution at scoring time (one reward component), and degrades gracefully when no key is set.
- **Languages** — source languages the pipeline supports.

## Bootstrap

Sandbox pipelines need a working Docker environment for the target repo. Repo2RLEnv's **bootstrap phase** builds it automatically — an LLM agent iterates shell commands inside a fresh container until the repo builds and its test suite collects, then commits and content-addresses the image. The expensive step runs **once per (repo, ref)**; every downstream task reuses the cache. `pr_diff` skips it entirely.

```bash
repo2rlenv bootstrap --repo <owner>/<repo> --llm anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

Design, cache layout, cost tracking: [`docs/reference/BOOTSTRAP.md`](./docs/reference/BOOTSTRAP.md).

## What you get out

A dataset that:

- **Is verifiable** — every task carries an executable test (`test_execution`) or a stored oracle diff (`diff_similarity`); your trainer picks the reward type.
- **Is content-addressed** — a `content_hash` over each task; identical artifacts ⇒ identical hash.
- **Trains anywhere via Harbor** — TRL, SkyRL, Prime-RL, Tinker, Miles, Slime, harbor.rl.
- **Evaluates with any agent harness** — Claude Code, OpenHands, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, …
- **Is language-agnostic by spec** — runtime pipelines emit a Dockerfile + shell verifier; `pr_diff` is pure text and works for any language.
- **Publishes natively** to the Hub — `repo2rlenv push` writes a Harbor-compatible `registry.json` so consumers `harbor download` (or `repo2rlenv pull`) with zero glue.
- **Supports private repos** end-to-end — `gh auth token` resolved automatically; build secrets declared by name; verifier-time secrets forbidden by spec.

## Under the hood

Our focus is **synthesis** — we don't reimplement sandboxes, agent harnesses, or a registry. Tasks are emitted in the [Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor) format (with a small `[metadata.repo2env]` block for provenance: pipeline, base commit, PR URL, content hash, reward kinds), so they run on Harbor's existing stack — Local Docker / Modal / Daytona / E2B / Runloop, 25+ agent harnesses, parallel execution, and the publishing CLI.

## Contributing a pipeline

Pipelines are pluggable by design — adding a synthesis strategy is the main way to extend Repo2RLEnv:

1. Implement the `Pipeline` protocol (`name` + `run() -> PipelineResult`) in `src/repo2rlenv/pipelines/`.
2. Register it in `PIPELINES` and add its options model; new pipelines start `experimental = True`.
3. `uv run pytest tests/test_pipeline_contract.py` enforces the contract.
