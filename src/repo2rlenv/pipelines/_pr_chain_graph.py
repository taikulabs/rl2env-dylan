"""Build replayable long-horizon PR chains from a repository's merge history.

Chaining pull requests naively does not work. Pick PRs #100, #400 and #900
because they touch the same subsystem and #400's patch will not apply on top of
#100's: the merges in between moved the code underneath it. Any chain built that
way is unverifiable, so it is not an RL environment.

This module uses the one ordering that is replayable by construction: the
**first-parent history** of the default branch. `git diff <c>^1 <c>` is exactly
the change the branch received at step `c`, whether the project squash-merges,
merge-commits or pushes directly. Replaying consecutive first-parent steps
reproduces history, so every intermediate tree is a real commit that really
passed CI.

A chain is a contiguous run of history split into gated stages:

    base ─[carry]─▶ c1^ ─[goal 1]─▶ c1 ─[carry]─▶ c2^ ─[goal 2]─▶ c2 ─▶ ...

Each stage ends on an *anchor* — a step whose diff touches both source and test
files, so a fail-to-pass oracle can exist for it. The stage's **goal** is the
anchor's own change: that is what the agent must implement. Steps that cannot
anchor a stage (formatting bots, dependency bumps, docs) become the stage's
**carry**, which the environment applies for free when the stage opens.

Carry is what makes the partition both gapless and fair. Gapless, because no
history is skipped, so stage k+1 starts from a real commit. Fair, because the
agent is never asked to reproduce a formatting sweep, yet a later stage whose
tests depend on that sweep still sees it.

Coherence comes from *selecting* windows, never from reordering them: a window
whose anchors concentrate on one subsystem reads as one sustained piece of work.
