"""pr_chain — many pull requests replayed as gated stages in one environment.

Every other pipeline here emits a *single* objective: fix one bug, implement one
function, patch one CVE. A competent agent finishes such a task in a handful of
actions, which makes the resulting environment useless for studying what happens
over a long horizon — planning, carrying context, recovering from a milestone
that went wrong twenty actions ago.

`pr_chain` emits one environment per contiguous run of repository history. Each
verified stage becomes one native Harbor step. Harbor runs the agent and
verifier for each step, and the task reward is the mean per-step score.

How the pieces divide up:

* `_pr_chain_graph`   — which runs of history are replayable, and where the
                        stage boundaries fall.
* `_pr_chain_validate`— each stage's fail-to-pass oracle, derived by running the
                        real tests at the real commits.
* `_pr_chain_steps`    — renders each stage as a native Harbor step, so the
                        runtime supplies the observation/action/reward loop.

The gold source diff for a stage never enters the container. Test payloads and
instructions do, which is the same disclosure `pr_runtime` already makes (its
`test.sh` carries the test patch inline).
